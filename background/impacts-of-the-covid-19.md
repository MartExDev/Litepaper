# The influence of COVID-19

COVID-19 had far-reaching consequences for the entire world, in terms of politics, everyday life, and the economy. Telework from home became a new trend, the physical economy, especially the travel industry, experienced decline, but online transactions and communication became common occurrences.

According to a report issued by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development that was published on 05/03/2021, due to the shutdowns occasioned by Coronavirus, there was sudden growth of e-commerce, with online sales growing from 16% of all retail sales in 2020 to 19%. (Source: "[Estimates of Global Ecommerce 2019 and preliminary assessment of COVID-19 impact on online retail 2020"](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/tn\_unctad\_ict4d18\_en.pdf))

According to the report, there was notable increase in a number of countries in regards to online sales, for South Korea the share was the highest, and in 2020 it reached 25.9%, which was higher than 20.8% in the previous year. At the same time, according to the latest estimates, global e-commerce sales jumped to 2.67 billion USD in 2019, which was 4% higher than 2018. This includes Business to Business (B2B), and Business to Consumer (B2C) sales figures, this is comparable to 30% of global gross domestic product for that year. These statistical data show that the importance of online activities is increasing.

There is probably no industry that has not been affected by the global coronavirus pandemic and the successive number of weeks spent in isolation.

Therefore, those industries that were able to increase profits at different times even under the conditions of an unfavorable climate have especially attracted attention.

Under these circumstances, digitization was accelerated, such as in the contexts of educational organizations or commerce, which must be mentioned first. Therefore, we believed travel for shopping may decrease in the long term, and the travel industry may experience changes, and that home offices and home education infrastructure might have an increase.

On the other hand, the purchasing of printers, headphones, or computers from local retailers is similar to purchasing other every day or non- every day times, but this remained impossible for some period of time. Up until now, e-commerce has become a significant segment of consumers, and in the future, they will become even more important.

According to a survey from German Digital Association Bitkom, more than 50% of people believe that online trade has become a central function of supply. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 20% of people have made online purchases. In a study by Forrester Consulting, more than 70% of consumers state that they are buying more products online than regular.

In terms of supply, retailers must search for fast answers to deal with the Coronavirus crisis online. Despite there being a great reduction in capacity, cross-border air transportation has made a decisive contribution towards maintaining trade here. One-third of respondents also stated that digital channels were critical to business.

The Forrester Consulting company's research also revealed additional astonishing results. According to this research, 50% of customers purchased products online that they had never purchased online before.

The interesting thing is looking at the results of specific industries. Although food product and daily use item orders increased by 15%, DIW products and toy orders also increased by 5%, and only the fashion industry experienced a decline. However here short-term consumer uncertainty has played a unique role.

Another study by Kantar showed in the three biggest e-markets of Europe, which are France, Germany, and England, 50% or more of consumers were shopping online, and that this had increased significantly. The same study also found that 60% of consumers would continue to purchase things online just like the present, even after the pandemic has ended.

Nielsen expressed a similar result in regards to the similar report on the Asian market.

During the COVID-19 period, the volume of online purchases of non-fast-moving products may continue to increase, many consumers plan to continue purchasing apparel, makeup, and electronic products on web platforms even after the pandemic has concluded.

Moreover, according to the Management Consulting Company, Capgemini, global consumers plan in the next 6-9 months to increase their online retail transactions even more.

According to the results of all studies, there are two outcomes that are not yet grasped. Internet purchasing, including cross-border purchasing, has become increasingly important globally. The intercontinental integration of the physical flow of products is only made possible with air transportation, because fast delivery has a significant impact on customer experiences. In regards to this, the Coronavirus Pandemic has had a catalyzing effect.\
